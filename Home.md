# Welcome to the Voice AI Daddy Wiki

You've found the command center. This is where you go from a developer with an idea to the master of a legion of autonomous voice agents.

### Why "Daddy"?

Because when it comes to building powerful, open-source voice AI, we're the authority. We got tired of the half-baked projects and the corporate gatekeepers. We built the framework we always wanted: powerful, flexible, and entirely under your control. This wiki is your roadmap to unleashing its full potential.
