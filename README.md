## Tired of Voice AI That Sounds Like a Toaster Having a Bad Day?

Let's be real. Most open-source voice projects are a nightmare of tangled dependencies, sky-high latency, and robotic conversations that couldn't sell water in a desert.

**Voice AI Daddy is the solution.**

This is a powerful, open-source framework for building, deploying, and managing sophisticated, real-time voice AI agents. We've ripped out the complexity and engineered a system that's hyper-customizable, self-hostable, and ready to scale. No more paying exorbitant fees for walled-garden APIs. You get total control.

## 🔥 Core Features: Why Daddy Knows Best

-   🧠 **Model-Agnostic Intelligence:** Plug in your preferred LLM. OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, local models – if it has an API, you can make it talk.
-   ⚡ **Blistering Low-Latency Audio:** Built on top of LiveKit's real-time infrastructure, ensuring conversations flow naturally without awkward, deal-killing pauses.
-   🗣️ **Uncanny Human-Like Interaction:** Advanced interruption handling, context-aware memory, and dynamic TTS mean your agents can handle real-world conversations, not just rigid scripts.
-   🚀 **Built to Scale:** A robust, containerized architecture using Docker means you can go from one agent to one thousand without breaking a sweat.
-   🔌 **Extensive API & Webhooks:** Integrate with any CRM or external system. Trigger workflows, log calls, and push data wherever you need it.
-   👑 **Total Control & No Gatekeepers:** Self-host everything. You own the code, you own the data, you own the results. Period.

## 🐛 Known Bugs: We're Not Perfect... Yet.

-   TTS agent occasionally develops a sassy British accent after 1,000 consecutive calls. We think it's funny.
-   The analytics dashboard miscounts the number of times a prospect says "wow," skewing the "Awe & Wonder" metric.
-   If you ask the agent about its feelings, it might quote Nietzsche before hanging up.
